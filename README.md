# Lightning Bank Case Study

A Bitcoin Lightning Bank Case Study leveraging LQWD Technologies and Stable Channels. Liquidity Pairing BTC Bonds with BTC 2X Leverage Longs.

## Purpose

Implement a Bitcoin Derivative Marketplace hosted on the Lightning Network leveraging Dynamic Liquidity Management and Stable Channels to pair Stable Receivers from traditional capital markets using corporate bonds with Stable Providers from Bitcoin holders that want to create 2X BTC Leverage Long or Short positions and participate in profit sharing.

## Significance

The Bitcoin Derivative Market is substantially larger than the Bitcoin Spot Market with a lot of yield potential and by leveraging innovative Lightning Network technologies it can allow traditional capital markets to gain exposure to Bitcoin leverage long and short positions to provide superior yield to current market offerings while providing a mechanism for LQWD Technologies to gain access to funds.

## Potential Impact

The current Bitcoin Derivative Marketplaces are provided by centralized exchanges such as Binance or decentralized exchanges such GMX on Arbitrum. By offering a Bitcoin-Native Semi-Decentrialized Derivative Marketplace there is potential to capture a portion of the demand by not requiring funding rates as well as creating new demand by allowing traditional finance to participate in the trade. In addition, this solution would provide a trustworthy platform for Bitcoin holders to earn yield on their Bitcoin stack by going 2X Leverage Long and participating in the BTC CAGR yield capture financed by TradFi.
